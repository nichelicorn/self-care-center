// Iteration 1: Minimum Viable Product (MVP) - Add Random Affirmation and Mantra feature
// When a user selects a message option and then clicks the “Receive Message” button, the user sees a random message from the list of possible messages for that category
// When the message appears, the mediation icon disappears from the message area

// goal : when a radio button is selected and the `Receive Message` button is clicked, several things will happen:
//  1) a random message will be generated based on the user input
//  2) the meditation icon will disappear from view
//  3) in its place, the random message will be displayed to the user

// 1a) write a function that will generate a random index number
//  b) write a function that will pull a value from the appropriate array, based on the random index generated
//  c) write a function that will replace the icon with an innerText
