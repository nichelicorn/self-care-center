#### Overview & [Challenge](https://frontend.turing.io/projects/module-1/self-care-center.html) Goals
- How can I care for myself? One way is with affirmations and mantras! Affirmations are thoughts of positive self-empowerment, meant to assert your self-worth. Mantras are repetitive phrases that are repeated again and again during mindfulness practices. Your challenge is to build an app that helps users remind themselves of their inherent value!

- This Solo Challenge gives students and instructors the opportunity to get a pulse on where you are with the foundational concepts of Module 1 curriculum. Students should use this as an opportunity to challenge themselves and work completely independently. Google can (and probably should!) be used, but any other code base should not be referenced. Instructors will be able to use your work, both completion of functionality and code quality, to determine where you stand and if you are behind for this point in the module, provide supports to intervene.

#### Learning Goals
- My learning goals for this challenge were to revisit some concepts we have touched on, including DOM manipulation, data manipulation, and relating the data model and the DOM. My secondary goal was to improve my familiarity with CSS, and practice using styles in ways I hadn't yet thought of.
- I chose the CYOA "User can favorite a message", as I was hoping to get to the Local Storage extension. I know this concept will be introduced next week, but I struggled with implementing this my first time through Mod 1.
- My final goal with this project is to complete the Intermediate CSS extension. I want to get good at CSS so I can use it to make lovely, pointless things!

#### Why was this project created?
- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events
- Individualize your programming skill set

#### How does this work?

- This app works through a user interface with buttons. The user will select which type of message they would like to receive by selecting a radio button, then clicking the `Receive Message` button.

- The message will appear in the box below the interface, with a new set of buttons! These new buttons will allow the user to add favorite messages to the site.
- To see their favorites (the Hearts), the user will click the `Visit Your Hearts`, and be taken to a new view displaying their Heart messages
- On the Heart page, users can delete messages by clicking the `‚úÇÔ∏è` scissor button. The user can also return to the Home view by clicking `Return Home`
- This page runs directly in the browser! üë©‚Äçüíª

- [CSS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS)

#### Project Reflection
- Overall, I think this project went well. I was able to work independently through most of the challenges I encountered. I practiced a LOT of pseudocoding, which was useful. I could still DO MORE PSEUDOCODING! It's so helpful! And gets my thoughts out of my head.
- I was not able to complete the Local Storage extension, which was my real end goal. It took me a lot longer than expected to target the necessary elements to delete the cards. I went down a few wrong paths, and these experiences helped me understand how certain pieces of code function and interact with one another. I got to look a little more into string methods, which was interesting, and just generally got an idea that I'm only at the beginning of understanding JavaScript!

##### Wins
- I was able to complete the challenge with minimal mentor intervention.
- I got my CSS looking decent, and managed to add one fun little feature that wasn't part of the comp.
- I learned more about how to use flex box, and am excited to learn more (and figure out the things I can do better!)

##### Challenges
- I didn't complete the Local Storage, and I feel a little sad about that üòø
- It took me a long time to work on the targeting for the deleteMessage() function

#### Future Features
- Local Storage
- Login page
- Update with custom mantras and affirmations
- Intermediate CSS
- User can add their own messages
- Error handling and clear button
- User can delete a message
- User never sees a repeated message
- All messages interface
